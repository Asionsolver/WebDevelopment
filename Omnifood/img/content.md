## About Omnifood

We are a technology company first, but with major focus in customer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. User can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and delivered all meals from the generated meals plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
